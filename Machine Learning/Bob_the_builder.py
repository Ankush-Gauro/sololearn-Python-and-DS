"""
Building a Logistic Regression model.

Task
You are given a feature matrix and a single datapoint to predict. Your job will be to build a Logistic Regression model with the feature matrix and make a prediction (1 or 0) of the single datapoint.

Input Format
First line: Number of data points in the feature matrix (n)
Next n lines: Values of the row in the feature matrix, separated by spaces
Next line: Target values separated by spaces
Final line: Values (separated by spaces) of a single datapoint without a target value

Output Format
Either 1 or 0

Sample Input

3 5
5 7
3 1
5 3
7 5
1 1 1 0 0 0
